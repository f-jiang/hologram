####`hologram-device`

- [x] verify combined program works for both encoder and vision tracking (non-PID)
- [x] `encPos %= 320`, and send readings to `model-viewer` (`uint16_t`, `buf[]`, `memcpy()` twice, `Serial.write()`)
- [ ] enable following even when blob isn't visible
- [ ] remove `memcpy()` calls
- [ ] see what is slowing down PVision

####`model-viewer`

- [ ] height tracking using camera readings
- [x] enable switching models within the program
  - slider (likely slick)
- [ ] set camera target to bound center
- [ ] automatically set zoom level and view target based on model size (`api.getNodes()`)
- gallery improvements
  - [ ] better, centered drawer icon
  - [ ] automatically close drawer on model select
  - [ ] only load new model if its slide has been explicitly clicked on (ignore drags, next/prev btn presses)
