####`hologram-device`

- [ ] verify combined program works for both encoder and vision tracking (non-PID)
- [ ] `encPos %= 320`, and send readings to `model-viewer` (`uint16_t`, `buf[]`, `memcpy()` twice, `Serial.write()`)
- [ ] verify that revised `PVision` and `PID` work, then add to this project and update usage throughout code
- [ ] PID vision tracking

####`model-viewer`

- [ ] height tracking using camera readings
- [ ] automatically set zoom level and view target based on model size (`api.getNodes()`)
- [ ] enable switching models within the program
  - slider (likely slick)
