####`feature branch merge order`
- [x] `relay-box`
- [ ] `blobless-tracking`
- [ ] `motion-limits`

####`hologram-device`

- [ ] eliminate y-value flickering when camera goes out of height bounds
- [ ] enable following even when blob isn't visible
- [ ] lock onto the user each time the web interface is opened
  - using socketio send from node to arduino serialread etc
- [ ] timeout after which low power mode begins
  - [ ] first will need to organize relay code (its own class)
- [ ] motor slew rate control
- [ ] see what is slowing down PVision
- [ ] PID vision tracking
- [x] verify combined program works for both encoder and vision tracking (non-PID)
- [x] `encPos %= 320`, and send readings to `model-viewer` (`uint16_t`, `buf[]`, `memcpy()` twice, `Serial.write()`)
- [x] remove `memcpy()` calls

####`model-viewer`

- [ ] set camera target to bound center
- [ ] get rid of the sudden jump in orientation after a model is loaded
- [ ] automatically set zoom level and view target based on model size (`api.getNodes()`)
- [x] height tracking using camera readings
- [x] enable switching models within the program
  - slider (likely slick)
- gallery improvements
  - [ ] only load new model if its slide has been explicitly clicked on (ignore drags, next/prev btn presses)
  - [ ] automatically close drawer on model select
  - [ ] better, centered drawer icon
