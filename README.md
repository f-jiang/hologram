  - frontend gui with model viewer, backend with hologram control and vision tracking
  - hologram power on -> boot into GUI on touchscreen
  - menu tree
    - model selection
      - my library
      - add new model
        - from filesystem (incl. external media) [or network]
        - [convert from other formats to .obj if needed]
      - [recent]
      - [favourites]
    - settings
      - adjust inactivity timeout
      - adjust range of motion and set center
      - target finding on model loaded
      - adjust target finding timeout
    - model viewing (fullscreen, on projector)
      - display switch from touchscreen to projector
      - quit using hardware button on hologram device
  - machine behaviour
    - gui mode (not viewing model):
      - only motors are powered
    - when viewing model:
      - when model first loaded, track user if the option is set
        - if timeout exceeded, return to aforementioned "gui mode"
      - displaying model: follow user, rotate model as needed
      - finding user when they're out of bounds:
        - also follow user and rotate model as needed
      - always
        - respect range of motion boundaries
