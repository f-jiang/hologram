# hologram

This is a prototype for a fog-screen hologram device. It has a rotating base with a fog screen emanating from the center of the base, with images provided by a projector. The base has an IR sensor, which is used to track the user, who must wear a special pair of glasses to make themselves visible to the sensor. Changes in base orientation are relayed over serial to a computer that provides the hologram with images. The computer runs a custom 3D viewer whose orientation changes when the base rotates. It is integrated with the SketchFab API, allowing the hologram to access a wealth of 3D models and animations for display.
